I've got some bad news. I wasn't able to mark these tasks as DONE:
<ul>
{Things:<li>{Description}</li>&#13;&#10;}
</ul>
This probably means I couldn't find the original tasks you sent me. I can only mark tasks as 
done if they have the same text as the original and if the original was created today or yesterday. 
Let me know if you want me to try again, otherwise, I believe you. Thanks for doing things.<br />
