{Opening} {FirstName}!<br />
<br />
Looking for a little help?
<br />
<br />
Here are the keywords I support today:
<ul>
<li>#ADD# - Adds a new thing to TeamThing board for you today</li>
<li>#REMOVE# - Removes a thing already on the board today</li>
<li>#UNDO# - Unremoves a thing and puts it back on today's board</li>
<li>#DONE# - Marks a thing on today's board as done (yay!)</li>
<li>#DELAY# - Moves a thing on today's board to tomorrow</li>
</ul>
You can also send an email with the subject "OPEN" and I'll send you a list of your open tasks.
<br />
<br />
To use a keyword, it needs to be the first word on a new line (followed by the thing text). And for all 
commands other than #ADD#, the thing text needs to match the original. I hate 
to be so strict, but it makes my life easier. I'll try to understand more in the future.
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
