Just a quick reminder to let me know what you're working on today. A quick email is all I 
need to update the team board and let everyone know what you're doing.
<br />
<br />
If you reply to this email, be sure to use the #ADD# keyword on the lines that represent 
things you want added to the board. You can also send me a new, blank email and I will automatically 
process each line as a new task for today.

[REMEMBER: You can always send an email with "HELP" in the subject for a list of all available keywords.]
