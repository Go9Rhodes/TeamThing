Busy day? There's always more time tomorrow. I've delayed these tasks and moved them to tomorrow for you:
<ul>
{Things:<li>{Description}</li>&#13;&#10;}
</ul>
If you would prefer to remove this task from your list, just reply and use the #REMOVE# keyword. I'll be 
happy to take this off of your list.<br />
