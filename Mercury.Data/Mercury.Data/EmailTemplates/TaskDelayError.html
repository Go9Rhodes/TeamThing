Sorry to say this, but I wasn't able to delay these tasks:
<ul>
{Things:<li>{Description}</li>&#13;&#10;}
</ul>
This probably means I couldn't find the original tasks you sent me. Make sure the task 
description exactly matches the original (that's how I find 'em). If things look right, 
then it's my fault. I'll try to get better at this.
