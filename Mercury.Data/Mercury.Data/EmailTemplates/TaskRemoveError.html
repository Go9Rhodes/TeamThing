It looks like you'll be doing a little more work today. I wasn't able to remove these things as you requested:
<ul>
{Things:<li>{Description}</li>&#13;&#10;}
</ul>
Usually this means I couldn't find the original tasks you sent me. I can only remove things 
if they have the same text as the original and if the original was created today or yesterday. 
Check what you sent me and try again, if you like. Or don't. It's up to you.<br />
