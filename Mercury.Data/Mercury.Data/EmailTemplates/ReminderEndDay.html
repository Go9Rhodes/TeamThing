The day is almost done and hopefully most of your tasks for today are done, too! Let 
me know what you've completed by replying to this message and putting #DONE# next to your finished tasks:
<ul>
{Things:<li>{Description}</li>&#13;&#10;}
</ul>
If something wasn't done today, use the #DELAY# keyword to move it to tomorrow or use #REMOVE# 
to get rid of it for now. Remember, TeamThing is a communication tool, so report accurately so your 
teammates know what's happening.
