Everybody makes mistakes, that's why I make them easy to fix! I've successfully removed these tasks:
<ul>
{Things:<li>{Description}</li>&#13;&#10;}
</ul>
If you've made <i>another</i> mistake and want to <i>unremove</i> any of these items, just mark them with #UNDO# and 
I'll restore them to your active list. I know, I'm incredible.<br />
