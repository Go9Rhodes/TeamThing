You rang, {FirstName}?<br />
<br />
Here's the list of open tasks I have for you today:
<ul>
{Things:<li>{Description}</li>&#13;&#10;}
</ul>
<br />
If you've finished any of these tasks, just reply with #DONE# next to the completed items. If you need to add or remove 
things, use the #ADD# and #REMOVE# keywords. Hope that helps!<br />
